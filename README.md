A. as input, is sound spectrogram from audio file.<br>
B. as output, is different spectrogram from input.<br>
Then,CAE is trained so that input spectrogram converts to corresponding output,
which is the same tone but different instruments.

Choosing output that is different from input makes the wonderful sound (that is created by AI).
